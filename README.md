# Project to monitor my HVAC system

I live in Florida and that means rising temperatures in the summer, along with surging electric bills for cooling.

A couple years back, my air conditioner had trouble keeping up with the hotter temperatures and seemed to run all the time.  By the time I got a technician out to look at it, most of the coolant had leaked out.  Refilling it was a big expense.  That got me thinking that I needed a better way to understand how the system was working.

Fresh off an ESPHome/Homeassistant project to monitor my home alarm system, I went looking for a solution.

I came across Jim Shank's great [AC Watcher project](https://github.com/jshank/ACWatcher/blob/main/README.md).  I used a number of his ideas that got this project moving much more quickly.  Thank you Jim!

Some of my functional goals:
- Monitor the current state of the HVAC system: heat/cooling, fan on/off, compressor on/off
- Monitor the effectiveness by sampling intake and discharge temperatures
- Monitor the temperatures where all that cold air runs through ducts sitting in a hot attic
- Monitor the power consumption of the whole system - compressor and air handler
- Minimal changes to the HVAC system, and nothing that would void any warranties.

I ended up building this in several parts:
- An ESPHome based monitor for everything other than power consumption
- A commercially available power monitor I could install in my breaker panel to capture the compressor and air handler power consumption.  More on this later.
- Homeassistant to provide visibility and additional, statstical, information

## Accessing HVAC state
In a traditional heap pump scenario, all the information about the state is available by monitoring the signals from the thermostat to the HVAC system.

A typical heat pump HVAC system is controlled by a thermostat which receives power form the air handler and sends control signals to the air handler and the compressor as illustrated below:

<img src="Images/BasicOperation.png" >

The signals to control the compressor (whether one or two stages), fan, auxillary heater and heat/cool mode are present as 0VAC or 24VAC on the connection between the thermostat and the air handler.  I tapped this cable, outside of the air handler, to get access to the HVAC state.  So I just picked up some thermostat wire (8/18 guage) at my local big box store and accessed the signals in my attic:

<img src="Images/ThermostatTap.jpeg" >

In my system, with a Honeywell FocusPROÂ® TH5000 thermostat, the signals are:
| Color  | Purpose                                                  | When High relative to Common |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Red    | Power.  24-28 VAC - Power thermostat and HVAC Monitor    | Always HIGH               | 
| Blue   | Common                                                   | Never high                   |
| Yellow | Contactor - Compressor main (or only) stage              | Compressor on                |
| Orange | Changeover - Selects heat or cool mode                   | Depends on thermostat / compressor |
| Green  | Fan                                                      | Fan on                       |
| White  | Auxillary / Emergency heat                               | Heater coils on              |

**NOTICE: OF COURSE,  YOU NEED TO DETERMINE THE CONFIGURATION FOR YOUR PARTICULAR SYSTEM.  THESE ARE COMMON FOR POPULAR HONEYWELL THERMOSTSATS.**

**IT IS ALSO CRITICAL FOR THIS IMPLEMENTATION THAT THE POWER NOT EXCEEED 30VAC.**


## HVAC Monitor Board
The HVAC monitor is built using a WEMOS D1 Mini ESP develpment board, running ESPHome.  

<img src="Images/Schematic_HVACMon2_2024-07-10.png">

The main blocks are:

- Power supply to convert the 24 to 28 VAC power to 5VDC.  For this, we take power from the power and common signals (red an blue in my case) and run it through a rectifier and into a LM2596S DC-DC buck converter.  Since 28VAC peaks at 30VDC and this device is rated for 12 to 30VDC, I added two diodes to drop the incoming DC volatage by 2-3V.  
Also, during development, I'd like to power the monitor with a USB port so there's a jumper to disconnect the output of the buck converter from the 5V input on the ESP board. When pins 1&2 are jumpered, power is provided externally.

- Signal conditioners to isolate the input AC signals and convert them to levels the ESP can handle.  I'm using 4N35 opto isolators, but any similar part would be fine. (I had a bunch lying around from a prior project). Since these are DC devices, a diode is needed along with the resistors to reduce the input current.  If you use an AC opto isolator, the diode isn't necessary.
There are two "common" terminals, one for the sensors and one for the power source. Jumping pins 1 and 2 connect these.  This allows a separate power source from the thermostat. **BUT NOTE: the commons are connected in the LM2596S buck converter, so a separate floating power source is required if you use this option.**

- Interface to Dallas DM18B20 type temperature sensors. This is a one-pin interface. The sensors use 3.3V, ground and a shared signal bus to send temperature readings. The probes for the intake, discharge and ambient temperatures can be connected with either a 4-pin header or KF2510 connectors. It doesn't matter which connector is used; probes are identified by address, not connector.

- WEMOS D1 Mini board.

Since the control signals are AC, they need to be converted to DC for the ESP.  But they're also 60HZ, so if the opto output were fed directly to the ESP, it'd be pulsing 60 times per second on each line.  Software debouncing could address that problem, but I used a hardware solution. A 4.7uF capacitor is connected to the opto output with a high pull-up resistor. When the AC signal is asserted, the capacitor is discharged through the isolator.  Before the next cycle, the voltage only builds up to about 500mv, which continues to read as a low signal by the ESP.  Feel free to play around with different capacitor and resistor values.

### Design Automation & Wiring
Schematics were captured with EasyEDA, a free scjeatioc capture and PCB design product which is aviliable online via browser or can be installed on a Windows, Mac or Linux machine.

My first prototype was all hand wired on three pad-boards. Needing to make another, I used the EasyEDA PCB layout tool to create a two-layer PC board.  For a very small amount of money and about 2 weeks, NextPCB.com delivered 5 boards.

You'll find the schematic and Gerber files in the Github repository.






===================
HVAC continues to be one of the highest energy devices in our household yet even the more advanced systems don't contain monitoring or alerting components to let you know when something isn't working correctly. This can be both frustrating and costly. Modern cooling systems will run the fan and compressor continuously, even if they aren't working properly. This solution aims to provide a simple and cost effective way of monitoring the performance of your system and alerting you when there are problems. 

There are 3 components:
- ACWatcher
	- An ESP based device installed near your HVAC system to monitor the state of the system (system active, intake temperature and discharge temperature)
- ESPHome
	- The firmware running on ACWatcher to send sensor output to Home Assistant
- Home Assistant
	- Central home automation system capable of integrating with hundreds of IoT solutions
	- Tracks historical performance
	- Alerts to abnormal operating conditions

## AC Watcher
For my installation, I used an ESP8266 based Wemos D1 Mini Pro. I [modified](https://youtu.be/hXRcJXMjlyg?t=111) the antenna jumper to utilize the external antenna since the unit was installed in the garage. The Wemos D1 Mini is compact while providing a single ADC to capture current (is the system running) and multiple GPIOs to communicate with the temperature probes.

Make sure to check all of your connections with a multimeter before you put it in the case. I also recommend getting ESPHome installed and working before putting it in the enclosure.

## ESPHome

        return true;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
```

### Finding the temperature sensor addresses
Connect the temperature probes to the screw terminals and then power up the ACWatcher with a USB connection that allows you to view the debug logs. Shortly after startup, you should see 2 different device addresses. You will replace my device addresses with your own:

```
[20:05:51][C][dallas.sensor:075]: DallasComponent:
[20:05:51][C][dallas.sensor:076]:   Pin: GPIO2
[20:05:51][C][dallas.sensor:077]:   Update Interval: 60.0s
[20:05:51][D][dallas.sensor:082]:   Found sensors:
[20:05:51][D][dallas.sensor:084]:     0x0e000005d3516128 <--Here is the address of the temp sensor!
[20:05:51][D][dallas.sensor:084]:     0x51000005d3a58b28 <--Here is the address of the other temp sensor!
```

Replace the addresses and then restart again. Make sure you know which one is which. I used a piece of green shrink wrap on one and black on the other to differentiate. You can always just swap the addresses in the configuration if you get it wrong. 

At this point, you can insert the intake probe through the space where your air filter goes. You can use some electrical tape to temporarily attach the discharge probe to the vent, about 2-ft above the cooling coils. Power up your ACWatcher and watch the output in the logs to confirm you are seeing a decent difference in temperature while running the system. 
### Calibrating the CT Clamp 
Follow the excellent tutorial at https://esphome.io/components/sensor/ct_clamp.html#calibration for calibrating your CT Clamp. I recommend starting with a known good load (like a incandescent lightbulb) to calibrate your clamp. Precision isn't very important since we're only interested in finding out if the device is on or off.

<img src="images/hvac%20wiring.jpeg" width=600 align=right>
Now that the clamp is calibrated. Open up your HVAC service cover and look inside for the electrical wiring. Look for the black wire, which should be thicker and clip the CT Clamp around it. Once again, check the logger output from ESPHome to make sure you are seeing an increase in current when the blower turns-on. Once you are fully calibrated, update the `hvac_on_threshold` variable to ~1/2 of the "on" value of your HVAC system. 

## Temperature Probes
I took a cue from the Honeywell HZ322 controller and designed a temperature probe similar to their solution. 3d print two of the [temperature probe holders](3dfiles/Temp%20Probe%20Holder.3mf). Make sure the holes are clear using a drill bit because you will want the **Stainless Steel Straw** to fit tightly. Depending on the depth of your vent, you may want to cut down the straw using a [tubing cutter](https://amzn.to/3Hf0BYM). If you do cut to tube, make sure to clean up the ends so you don't cut the cable while feeding it through. Next, press the straw into the temperature probe holder. Once I had it started, I placed the straw end flat on my work bench and pressed down hard until it was seated. Now feed the temperature probe through the straw and out the smaller hole in the back of the temperature probe holder. The finished product should look something like this.  
<img src="images/temp_probe.jpeg" width=600>

If everything looks correct, draw the temperature probe cabling into the body of the straw and then put another piece of shrink tubing on to stabilize the probe. Here is a view of the fully assembled probe, from inside the air return space.

<img src="images/intake_probe_inside.jpeg" width=600>

Wire everything up again and make sure the probes are working correctly before the next step.

### Temperature Probe Installation
<img src="images/intake_probe_outside.jpeg" width=300 align=right>Starting with the intake probe, locate a portion of the duct work or blower/furnace mounting pedestal. Making sure you don't damage anything inside the space, drill a 1/4" hole into the area and slide the probe in. You can see my location in the image above coming through the sheetrock below my HVAC blower, just in front of the main air return for the house. Insert the probe and affix with two appropriately sized screws.

For the discharge probe, you will want to place the probe a few feet away from the blower to avoid damaging the probe when the heat is in use. Check out the [Honeywell DATS manual](https://manuals.plus/honeywell/c7735a1000-duct-air-temperature-sensor-manual) for guidance. You're likely going to be drilling into the duct work so carefully examine where you are drilling and make sure you won't damage anything inside the space. Carefully drill a 1/4" hole, just enough to penetrate the duct without the bit going too far in. Use a flashlight and make sure the space is clear before inserting the probe. If the hole looks good, place the probe into the hole and mark or drill two smaller holes for the temperature probe mount screw holes on either side of the main probe. Use sheet metal screws to affix the temperature probe mount to the duct work. One last time, connect it all up and check that everything is still working properly. 

<img src="images/discharge_probe.jpeg" width=400>

### Final Mounting
<img src="images/acwatcher_mounted.jpeg" width=400 align=right>
At this point, find a good place to mount the ACWatcher, preferably not directly on the HVAC unit to avoid temperature problems. You can easily extend the temperature probe cabling up to ~50-ft without issue if needed. I used double-sided mounting tape but included an updated enclosure that has mounting tabs. 

## Home Assistant
Home Assistant has native access to ESPHome devices through the integrations panel. Take a look at https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html for details. Once the integration is configure properly, in Home Assistant, go to **Settings** -> **Add Integration** - **ESPHome** and enter the IP address of the ACWatcher. If you kept the same device names as I did in the device configuration, the following automation will work for you.

```
- id: cooling_problems
  alias: "Notify Cooling Problems"
  trigger:
    - platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.delta_t
      below: 15
      for: "00:10:00"
  condition:
    condition: and
    conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.hvac_state
      state: 'on'
      for: "00:05:00"
    - condition: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.discharge_temperature
      below: 80
  action:
    - service: notify.mobile_app_pixel_5
      data:
        message: 'HVAC appears to be ineffective. Please check it out.'
```

I'm sure I'll develop additional solutions and enhance this script once we're in the heating season, but it covers me for now. 

## Possible Improvements
It would be nice to know what mode the HVAC system was in (heating or cooling) so that I can track heating performance as well. Right now I just ignore the output if the discharge temperature is greater than 80Â°F. Thermostats control the system by closing the circuit on a 24V AC loop between the Y/yellow (cooling) wire and the C/black wire (common). Something like a ZMPT101B voltage sensor would allow you to step-down the 24VAC to 3.3v so you could measure with another ADC. A better solution would be to use a [24vac controlled relay](https://amzn.to/3txCOO7) for a simple on/off that I could connect to another GPIO.
